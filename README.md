# Age & Gender Detection

## Overview
This project utilizes Machine Learning (ML) and Computer Vision (CV) techniques to detect age and gender from facial images. Our system is driven by the need for enhanced security measures and personalized user experiences. The project involves rigorous preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using sophisticated algorithms ranging from classical machine learning techniques to convolutional neural networks.

## Features
- **Face Detection:** Detect and analyze faces within images or videos.
- **Age Estimation:** Accurately predict the age group of detected faces.
- **Gender Classification:** Determine the gender based on facial features.
- **Performance Metrics:** Utilizes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for performance assessment.
